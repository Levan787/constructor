# constructor
I use generic class set<T>, child class SortedSet<T>, in this assignment. 
I use all methods which was presented in assignment description: overrided methods, overloaded operators, delegates, Icomparable interfaces. 
I add operator overload to sortedSet<T> if other one will not work. 
I also create set<T> to call default constructor and parametrized constructor in driver. 
I have to create list gathering and IEnumarable type for other one. 
In the end I test Add(), Remove(), Filter(), overload operator all methods what was given.
